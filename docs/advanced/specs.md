# Specifications

When asking for LTSP advice, it's a good idea to share as much information as possible. Here's an example:

* 1 server: [i7-8750H with 12403 cpubenchmark score](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-8750H+%40+2.20GHz&id=3237) and 8 GB RAM
* 10 clients: [i3-6100 with 5483 cpubenchmark score](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i3-6100+%40+3.70GHz&id=2617) and 4 GB RAM
* 2 switches: one 8 port gigabit and one 8 port 100 Mbps
* Software: LTSP version 20.04, distribution Ubuntu 20.04.1, flavour MATE, kernel 5.4
* Use case: running educational applications and browsing

So, saying "I have a quad core CPU" isn't appropriate feedback, as it may have 1000 or 10000 score. It's best to mention the exact CPU, its cpubenchmark.net score, and how much RAM it has.
