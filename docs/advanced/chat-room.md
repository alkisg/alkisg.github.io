# Chat room

LTSP currently has two online chat rooms with mirrored content:

* [Matrix room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ltsp:matrix.org): the main room; it requires signing up for a free matrix account. It also offers logging, voice/video chat and an android application.
* [Libera.chat IRC channel](https://ts.sch.gr/repo/irc): an IRC channel, bridged with the Matrix room. It allows unregistered users; logs are available at [https://irclogs.ltsp.org](https://irclogs.ltsp.org).

The same rooms can also be used for [Epoptes support](https://epoptes.org).

Note that the [Freenode IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/#ltsp) has been deprecated since the move to libera.chat and it's not used anymore.
